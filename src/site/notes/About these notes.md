Notes on cybersecurity. These are just my random observations, *[just for me](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zXDPrYcxUSZbF5M8vM5Y1U9)* but you can read them if you like.

## Start here:

[[Malware/Scripting malware with Python\|With my first note]] and then you should check out [[Pen Testing/Hackers Attack Every 39 Seconds  2017-02-10  Security Magazine\|some interesting stuff]] [[Pen Testing/What is The Cyber Kill Chain and How to Use it Effectively\|I've found on the web]].
