Do you think that having a breadth of technical knowledge in different domains could help with a transition into #cybersecurity?

I know it sounds ridiculous but I was watching a YouTube video on malware and [[Malware/Malware#^bc586f\|I thought about macOS disk images and pkg files, both of which are basically folders, or glorified containers]].

I wondered if you could possibly distribute [[Malware/Malware\|Malware]] in either one of these containers, [[Pen Testing/What is The Cyber Kill Chain and How to Use it Effectively#^4214be\|specifically through pirated software]]. 

Ok great. Got the malware installed and it is executable. [[Pen Testing/What is The Cyber Kill Chain and How to Use it Effectively#^666162\|What is The Cyber Kill Chain and How to Use it Effectively#^666162]].

There are three levels of permissions in Gatekeeper:

Only allow software from the Mac App Store
Allow installation from the MAS and identified developers 
Off

## Attacks

Race conditions
JWT vs Cookies vs base64 passwords
