Do you think that having a breadth of technical knowledge in different domains could help with a transition into #cybersecurity?

I know it sounds ridiculous but I was watching a YouTube video on malware and I thought about macOS disk images and pkg files, both of which are basically folders, or glorified containers.

I wondered if you could possibly distribute [[Malware\|Malware]] in either one of these containers, specifically through pirated software. 

Ok great. Got the malware installed and it is executable. But ah. Apple has Gatekeeper, a security tool to prevent the installation of malicious software.

There are three levels of permissions in Gatekeeper:

Only allow software from the Mac App Store
Allow installation from the MAS and identified developers 
Off
